I have data that pertains to homelessness in King County and Seattle, which was gathered over a period spanning from 1998 to 2020. The data can be sorted into various categories, such as demographics, cause, or region. The second tab in my application displays a barplot showcasing the different causes of homelessness in the data. The plot also has two widgets: one allows the user to change the color of the bars and the other enables them to select different data to display. The third tab contains a table that shows data related to homelessness. There is a widget that lets the user choose a specific demographic to view in the table.
